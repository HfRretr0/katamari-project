# katamari-project
Katamari Damacy implementation focused on camera, textures, and lighting. The player controls a sphere, collecting objects by touching them, which then anchor to it. Features a camera system (1st-person and 3rd-person) and specific lighting (constant sun, sphere emits light on object collection).
